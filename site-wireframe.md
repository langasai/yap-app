## Pricing

- We should think about how to price the product. I think we should have a free tier that limits you to 1 minute conversations, and a preset number of custom conversations with no pronunciation correction.

- We should have a paid tier that allows you to have unlimited conversations, and pronunciation correction.

# FAQ

- What is the difference between Yap and Duolingo? 
  - Yap is focused on audio conversations that is customizable to your needs and interests while Duolingo is focused on reading and writing with a preset default curriculum. 

- How does Yap work?
  - Yap uses a combination of speech recognition, translation, and pronunciation correction to help you learn a new language. Yap encourages you to begin speaking in your target language right away, and then correct your pronunciation. You can decide the topics you want to speak about. Speaking is not just a one way process, but a two way conversation - so you can ask questions about art history or science in your target language, and learn about the history of science or art in your target language. 

- How does Yap simulate immersion?
  - Yap encourages you to begin conversations in your target language right away. When you first begin using Yap, you may not be able to speak at all, and that is okay. Yap can also begin conversations in your native language and start mixing in your target language as you become more comfortable. Yap allows you to customize scenarios that you can speak about, training your inner voice to speak your target language.

- Is my data safe?
  - Yap does not store any of your data, and does not use any of your data to train our models. In fact, we do not even have a data base for you to store your conversations. Our product is the model that you use to speak your target language. 

- How do I get started?
  - You can get started by signing up for a free account, and then you can begin speaking in your target language right away. We offer upgrades to a paid tier that allows you to have unlimited conversations, and pronunciation correction. 

- Can my business use Yap?
  - Yes! We offer custom pricing for businesses that want to use Yap for their employee training. We also offer a seperate educational pricing tier for schools that want to use Yap for their students.
